# Soumik Ghosh | Frontend Developer Portfolio

A high-performance, minimalist portfolio website engineered to showcase my work and technical expertise. Built from the ground up using React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, focusing on fluid interactivity and clean architectural patterns.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Core**: React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first architecture)
- **Animation**: Framer Motion (Orchestrated entrance animations, scroll-triggered reveals)
- **Bundling**: Vite

##  Design Philosophy

The UI follows a strict "absolute intent" philosophy—stripping away decorative noise to focus on content and motion.

- **Visuals**: Dark mode aesthetic with subtle glassmorphism (`backdrop-filter`) and calculated gradients.
- **Typography**: Inter font family for optimal legibility across devices.
- **Performance**: Zero layout shift, optimized asset loading, and hardware-accelerated animations.

##  Features

- **Component-Driven Architecture**: Modular components for Hero, Skills, and Projects sections.
- **Responsive Layout**: Fluid adaptation from mobile to 4K displays.
- **Interactive Elements**:
  - Magnetic button effects.
  - Scroll-aware navigation with active state tracking.
  - Staggered list animations for optimized perceived performance.
